# PMDG Procedure Generator

Hi there! Thank you for coming here! Good to have somebody using this web application!

## Preview

## Motivation
This application is aiming to provide the user with a faster way to create customised SID/STAR procedures for their PMDG aircrafts. I was inspired by one of my friends, who had spent some time on creating procedures in PMDG format for some airports/procedures that have not been published in the public version of AIP, and hence not been included in data provided by Navigraph. Manually writing them can sometimes end up spending too much time before an online pilot can start enjoying the flight. Also, any small typo in the file may ruin the mood, especially when spending more than half an hours of extra time to "debug" the code, then realized one single character is missing from the file! ðŸ˜© The usage of automation can (hopefully!) potentially save an online pilot.

As a result, I sat down in front of my computer and wrote this application as one of my personal projects. I only spent a few hours writing this mockup so I left many functionalities empty/not implemented. I may continue updating it in the next few months for more polishments, functionalities and UI improvements.

## Limitations
Currently, NO user input will be validated in the current version. There may also be some logical bugs, as I have only vaguely tested it. Also, I did not spend very much time on this project, advanced features, like same procedure for multiple runways, are not supported. After all planned functionalities are completed, the source code will be published on GitHub. If you found any bug, let me know and see how we can fix it or improve it. ðŸ˜‰

## How to Use?
The philosophy of using this application is simple! It should be designed to allow the user to finish creating a procedure only using a keyboard, with the help of <kbd>tab</kbd> and <kbd>space</kbd> key. Every line represents a waypoint in the procedure. Every time when a new line is added, the cursor will automatically be relocated to focus on the new line. So,
+ use <kbd>tab</kbd> to move the cursor to the next input box
+ use <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> to move backward
+ use <kbd>space</kbd> to press the buttons
In the future version, more keyboard shortcuts will be added to further simplify the usage.
